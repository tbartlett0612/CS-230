1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a company that had made a game that was available as an app for Android users. They were looking to expand this game to be able to be played as a
web-based game.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I felt I was able to determine the design constraints very well.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I felt having the larger picture defined by the design constraints and then having the Domain model gave a good view as to how the game is to be designed.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would want to go back and revise the Evaluation portion of this document as I feel I could have added more research into each section to provide better detail that could be used into giving the best recommendations.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took the requirements from the client, the design constraints, and the current functionality of the app that was already created and found the best way to merge these into the software design. When working on a project like this, it is not only important to listen to the client, but to also consider the user as ultimately the success  of the software is how the user likes it.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I made sure that any changes that were made to the software fell within the requirements/constraints of the client. Having a good plan laid out ahead of time makes the  software development go smoothly. In the future I would make sure that the Software Design Document is as complete as can be so that I know what it is that is required of me, and so that the client is able to follow along the process and can see any recommendations I may have based on my expertise.
